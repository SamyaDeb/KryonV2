/**
 * stats-aggregator.ts
 *
 * Rolls Fill + PnlEvent + BalanceChange rows into the leaderboard/portfolio
 * aggregate tables (TraderStat, AccountAnalytics) and writes periodic
 * LeaderboardSnapshot rows. Idempotent — safe to run repeatedly. Designed to
 * be invoked on a cadence (cron / the indexer loop) or standalone.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   DATABASE_URL=... npx tsx scripts/stats-aggregator.ts          # one pass
 *   DATABASE_URL=... npx tsx scripts/stats-aggregator.ts --loop   # every 30s
